            <p class="section-paragraph">In 1922, Inter were in Group B of the CCI First Division and came in last place after picking up only 11 points in the season. Inter remained in the top league after winning two salvation play-offs.
                In 1928, during the Fascist era, the club was forced to merge with the Unione Sportiva Milanese and was renamed Società Sportiva Ambrosiana.[2] For the 1928–29 season, they wore white shirts around this time with a red cross emblazoned on it: this design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan, which in turn derives from the flag of the patron saint of Milan, St. Ambrose, and dates back to the fourth century. In 1929, incoming president Oreste Simonotti decided to change name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana and restored the original black-and-blue striped jerseys. Supporters, however, continued to call the team Inter, and in 1931 (after U.S. Milanese reconstitution), new president Pozzani caved to shareholder pressure and changed the name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter.
                Their first Coppa Italia (Italian Cup) was won in 1938–39, led by the great legend Giuseppe Meazza, for whom the San Siro stadium is officially named, and a fifth league championship followed in 1940, despite an injury to Meazza. After the end of World War II, the club re-emerged under their original name: Internazionale. Following the war, Inter won its sixth championship in 1953 and the seventh in 1954. Following the golden era of the 1960s, Inter managed to win their 11th league title in 1971 and their 12th in 1980. Inter were defeated for the second time in five years in the final of the European Cup, going down 0–2 to Johan Cruyff's Ajax in 1972. During the 1970s and 1980s, Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally, in 1977–78 and 1981–82.
                Led by the German duo of Andreas Brehme and Lothar Matthäus and the Argentine Ramón Díaz, Inter captured the 1988–89 Serie A championship. Fellow German Jürgen Klinsmann and the Italian Supercup were added the following season, though Inter failed to defend their Serie A title, finishing in third behind champions Napoli and city rivals Milan, respectively.</p>

            <p class="section-paragraph">If you ever wondered why you’ve not seen an Inter footballer wear a number 3 shirt recently, it’s because it will forever belong to one man 一 Giacinto Facchetti.Born in Italy in 1942, young Giacinto wanted to be a doctor but ended up part of the ‘Grande Inter’ team that brought opponents to their knees.Before joining Inter, Giacinto was a striker for his local youth club, CS Travigliene. However, that would change after he signed for Inter Milan. Between 1960 and 1978, Facchetti made a name for himself at Inter, serving as the club’s star full-back. From the highest scoring Inter defender, we move to the club’s longest-serving captain. Giuseppe ‘Beppe’ Bergomi started training with Inter at 16 before spending 20 years with the club.Like Facchetti, Bergomi was a one-club man, playing his entire career at Inter.However, his boyhood allegiance would not stop him from playing all of his 756 club matches for Inter, achieving a feat most footballers dream of.But there is more to Bergomi than his many appearances. He was a legendary defender and leader back in his day and remains an iconic figure in Inter to date. Beppe held the title of Inter’s most capped player for a while until a phenomenal player came along and smashed it; that footballer’s name is Javier Zanetti.Javier Zanetti is an Argentinian who came to Inter in 1995 at the age of 22. Back then, many didn’t expect much from him, focusing instead on Sebastian Rambert.Eventually, Zanetti proved them wrong by having an illustrious career as a Nerazzurri winger, full-back, and midfielder.Zanetti was an entertainer at first. Fans couldn’t get enough of his dazzling runs and feints from the wing as he turned opposition defenders inside out.</p>

            <p class="section-paragraph">Angelo Moratti (Somma Lombardo 5 November 1909 – Viareggio 12 August 1981) was an Italian oil tycoon and the former owner of Inter Milan from 1955 to 1964. In 1963, Moratti founded Saras S.p.A., an energy multinational corporation with operations in petroleum refining, marketing, transportation, and power generation.
                In 1955, he became the owner and chairman of Serie A football club Internazionale Milano F.C.[1] Under his ownership and Helenio Herrera's coaching, Inter thrived, earning the nickname of Grande Inter for their national and international success.[4][5] Angelo Moratti was the second most victorious owner in the history of the club, behind his son Massimo who owned the club from 1995 to 2004 and from 2006 to 2013. Massimo Moratti (born 16 May 1945) is an Italian billionaire petroleum businessman, the former owner of Inter Milan and chairman of the Saras Group, founded in 1962 by his father, industrialist Angelo Moratti. The main production site of the Saras Group is the Sarroch refinery located on the island of Sardinia, one of Europe's only six supersites, with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, representing 15% of refining capacity in Italy. In recent years, initially to enable independence of the Sarroch refinery from terms of energy, the Saras Group has entered into the production of electricity and is expanding its production of alternative energy sources, particularly in the field of wind energy, through its subsidiaries Sarlux and Sardeolica, the latter of which is controlled indirectly through the company Eolici Ulassai.</p>
